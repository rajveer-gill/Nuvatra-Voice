## 📞 The Sales Pitch (2-3 minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)

**The Problem:** You're probably missing calls when you're busy, or customers have to wait on hold. 

**The Solution:** Our AI answers every call instantly, 24/7, in any language. It can answer FAQs, take reservations, and forward calls when needed.

**The Demo:** Want to see it in action? I can call our demo number right now."

---

### The Demo Call (2 minutes)

**What to show:**
1. **Instant greeting** - "See how it answers immediately? No hold time."
2. **FAQ handling** - "What are your hours?" → Shows it knows their info
3. **Multi-language** - "It speaks any language your customers speak."
4. **Reservation booking** - "It can book appointments automatically."
5. **Call forwarding** - "If it can't help, it forwards to you."

**Demo script:**
```
1. Call demo number
   → "See? Instant answer, no hold time."

2. "What are your hours?"
   → "It knows all your business info."

3. "Can I make a reservation?"
   → "It can book appointments automatically."

4. [Switch to Spanish] "Hola, ¿cuáles son sus horarios?"
   → "It speaks any language your customers speak."

5. "Thanks, bye!"
   → "Professional, natural conversation."
```

### Objection Handling

**"We don't get that many calls"**
→ "Even 5-10 missed calls a week is lost revenue. Plus, it's 24/7 - customers can call anytime."

**"We already have someone answering"**
→ "What happens when they're busy? Or after hours? This ensures every call is answered, and your staff can focus on in-person customers."

**"How much does it cost?"**
→ "Starts at $149/month. That's less than $5/day to never miss a call. Most businesses see ROI in the first month from captured leads."

**"Does it sound robotic?"**
→ "No! Listen to the demo - it uses premium AI voices. Most people can't tell it's AI."

**"What if it makes a mistake?"**
→ "It forwards to you if it's unsure. Plus, you can review all conversations and train it on your specific FAQs."

**"We need to think about it"**
→ "Totally understand! Can I leave you with a business card? I can also set up a free trial - you can test it for a week, no commitment."

### Closing (30 seconds)

**If they're interested:**
"Great! Here's what I need from you to get started:
1. Your business info (hours, address, services)
2. Your phone number (we'll set up a new number or port yours)
3. Any special FAQs or policies

I can have you set up in 24-48 hours. Want to start today?"

**If they need time:**
"No problem! Here's my card. I can also set up a free trial - you can test it for a week, see how it works with your actual calls. No commitment. Sound good?"

## 🚨 Red Flags (Don't Waste Time)

**Skip if:**
- They have < 5 calls per week (not worth it)
- They're closing soon (waste of time)
- They're extremely tech-averse (will be a support nightmare)
- They want it for free (not serious)

**Focus on:**
- Businesses with 10+ calls per day
- Appointment-based businesses
- Multi-language customer base
- After-hours inquiries
- Busy periods where calls are missed

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always demo live** - Seeing is believing
2. **Use their language** - If they speak Spanish, demo in Spanish
3. **Focus on ROI** - "How many calls do you miss? Each one is lost revenue."
4. **Offer free trial** - Reduces risk, increases conversion
5. **Follow up same day** - Strike while iron is hot
6. **Get referrals** - "Know any other businesses that could use this?"
